* Please read install.txt for how to install and run this demo application zkfuse.

* Why is this demo app named zkfuse?
  
  Well, I was a fan of the appfuse framework but now I am a fan of ZK framework at time of writing this so the name I come up
  with now is zkfuse.
  
* Why Shiro demo? 

  It is way way ... way easier to use, get your head around and get it working THAN Spring Security!!
  For quick tutorial of using Shiro with ZK: http://books.zkoss.org/wiki/Small_Talks/2012/March/Securing_ZK_Applications_With_Apache_Shiro

* Is ZK better than GWT, JSF, Seam?

  Yes IMHO. But hey I am biased already from the start. ;)
