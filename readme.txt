* Please read install.txt for how to install and run this demo application zkfuse.

* Why is this demo app named zkfuse?
  
  Well, I was a fan of the appfuse framework but now I am a fan of ZK framework at time of writing this so the name I come up
  with now is zkfuse.
  
* Why Shiro demo? 

  It is way way ... way easier to use, get your head around and get it working THAN Spring Security!! OK, I didn't give
  Spring Security 3 a fair go since I have been bitten by the horror of Spring Security 2.x(a.k.a Acegi).
  
  Plus, Shiro also supports acceess to LDAP and AD out of box like Spring Security. Except easier to use IMHO.

* Did I write most of the code myself?

  Well, most of the code is indeed written by me but I couldn't have done it without the help of resources from web
  (thanks Google, StackOverflow) and the ZK, maven knowledge I learned in my current company.

* Is ZK better than GWT, JSF, Seam?

  Yes IMHO. But hey I am biased already from the start. ;)
