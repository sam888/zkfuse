- Tools used: MySQL 5.5.20 for database. Maven for build.

1. Create and populate a database named zkfuse first by running the zkfuse.sql

2. Unzip the project zkfuse.rar and import the maven project into your favourite IDE. 
   Find and open up the file default.properties, look for the lines

    jdbc.connection.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/zkfuse
	jdbc.connection.username=root
	jdbc.connection.password=password
	
   These are the username and password for connecting to your database. Change as required for your database.

   If database is not at localhost, change as required, e.g. change
   jdbc.connection.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/zkfuse to
   jdbc.connection.url=jdbc:mysql://<IP Address of MySQL>:3306/zkfuse

3. To configure Shiro for authentication login demo, open up shiro.ini at /zkfuse/zkfuse_web/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/shiro.ini.
   Look for the lines

        ds.jdbcUrl = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/zkfuse
        ds.user = root
        ds.password = password

   Those are the username and password of your database(like 2. above). Change them to match your database.

   If database is not at localhost, change as required, e.g. change
      ds.jdbcUrl = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/zkfuse to
      ds.jdbcUrl = jdbc:mysql://<IP Address of MySQL>:3306/zkfuse

4. To build from command line, cd into the project folder 'zkfuse', then simply run the maven command: mvn clean install

5. To run from command line, cd into the project folder 'zkfuse', then cd again into zkfuse_web folder, run the maven command: jetty run

6. Open up a browser and points to localhost:8080/zkfuse_web

7. Default log file location is C:/logs/zkfuse/zkfuse.log. Tweak logging levels in log4j.xml at
   \zkfuse\zkfuse_web\src\main\resources\log4j.xml as required.
